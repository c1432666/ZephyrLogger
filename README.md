ZephyrLogger
============

Logger application for Zephyr HxM BT.

Thanks to Pye Brook Company, Inc. (http://www.pyebrook.com , info@pyebrook.com) who developed the code on which this project is based.


Notes
-----

At the moment the UI is styled towards using the "menu"-button on older Android phones to interact with certain features. 

This will be changed soon, so as the project will be optimal for API-level 9 or later.
